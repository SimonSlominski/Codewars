# Codewars
### Code challenges focused on improving skill and technique

All tasks come from www.codewars.com and their level is compatible with kata (level) from the platform.

## What's a kata?

Kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.

## What's kyu?

**Kyu/Dan Ranks**

Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.

**Earning Ranks**

You can advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above your rank - the harder the kata the faster you advance.

**Honor**

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. Honor is earned fastest through creating kata, crafting great solutions, and constructive comments.
