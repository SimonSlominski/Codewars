TASK: Convert a Boolean to a String

In this example, the input to boolean_to_string (represented by the variable b) is a boolean.

Lastly, when we want to take one action if a boolean is true, and another if it is false, we use an if-statement.

For this kata, don't worry about edge cases like where unexpected input is passed to the function.

    return str(b)
