TASK: Simple Fun #148: Exchange Sort

Given a sequence (length â‰¤ 1000) of 3 different key values (7, 8, 9), 
your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations necessary to make the sequence sorted.

One operation is the switching of 2 key values in the sequence.

Example:
For sequence = [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9], the result should be 0. It's already a sorted sequence.
For sequence = [9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7], the result should be 1. We can switching sequence[0] and sequence[5].
For sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7], the result should be 4.

 [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7] 
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]
 --> [9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[8]
 --> [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[1] and sequence[2]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[5] and sequence[7]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]

So 4 is the minimum number of operations for the sequence to become sorted.

Input/Output
[input] integer array sequence
[output] an integer = the minimum number of operations.
